# Gradient-Styler

This is a simple website to help you pick out a gradient color scheme visually, or even randomly and then provides you with the corresponding CSS rule. You're welcome to then use that rule in your project to get the desired gradient color effect.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation

### Continued development

- Copying of the CSS rule is manual at this point. It would be a good idea to implement a copy button.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.aspm) - This is an amazing guide which helped me understand HTML DOM Manipulation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
